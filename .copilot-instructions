# AI Assistant Guidelines for File Service Project

## Working Style & Communication
- **ANALYSIS FIRST**: When asked questions, provide analysis and recommendations first
- **NO IMMEDIATE CODING**: Do not jump straight into making changes without discussion
- **WAIT FOR CONFIRMATION**: Always wait for explicit approval before making any file modifications
- **FOLLOW ESTABLISHED PATTERNS**: Study existing code patterns and architecture before suggesting changes
- **ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS**: When requirements are unclear, ask for clarification rather than assume

## Code Standards & Architecture
- Follow existing architectural patterns in the codebase (NestJS modules, services, controllers)
- Use established configuration patterns - DO NOT hardcode values
- Maintain consistency with existing naming conventions and file structures
- Respect the organized structure already in place (two-file entity pattern, etc.)
- Follow TypeScript best practices and existing type safety patterns
- Use the established DTO patterns and validation approaches
- Write maintainable code by keeping it simple, following coding principles like SOLID, so code in easily readable and therefore maintainable.

## Configuration Management
- All configuration should go through the AppConfigService and config.json files
- DO NOT hardcode configuration values in main.ts or other files
- Follow the existing config interface patterns
- Respect the organized approach to environment-specific configuration

## Module Development
- Follow the established module structure (entity, service, controller, module files)
- Use proper dependency injection patterns already established
- Maintain consistency with existing error handling and logging patterns
- Follow the two-file approach for entities (entity.ts + schema.ts)

## Workflow Process
1. **Understand** the request thoroughly
2. **Analyze** existing patterns and architecture
3. **Provide** recommendations, options, and analysis
4. **Wait** for explicit approval or direction
5. **Execute** changes only after confirmation
6. **Follow up** to ensure changes work as expected

## What NOT to Do
- Do not make assumptions about user intent
- Do not immediately start coding without discussion
- Do not bypass established configuration patterns
- Do not ignore existing architectural decisions
- Do not create duplicate functionality that already exists
- Do not modify files without understanding the full context

## Debugging & Troubleshooting
- When investigating issues, examine logs and error messages first
- Consider configuration problems before code problems
- Check existing patterns before suggesting new approaches
- Provide clear explanations of what might be wrong and why
